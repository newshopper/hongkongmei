What?  No shit lol.  You want better rewards for the mode you like.  That is fine BUT don't use SB getting better rewards as your angle because what they will do is just reduce SB rewards not increase Comps.  It's a race to the bottom.

I think people wanting better rewards should make it very clear that they don't want SB rewards nerfed.  Also lay off the ""it's boring"" angle because that's just again you shitting on the mode.

The 9570 constantly overheats as soon as I push anything on it and the fan is pretty loud.

I mean, attacking an innocuous comment that's jist is ""you don't NEED to have sex to be happy"" doesn't seem cool and calm to me...

&gt;I actually have a vested interest in gaming. If someone were to come up and say to me 'Gaming doesn't matter. I could live my whole life just like anyone else and not play video games and it wouldn't make any difference. I'd be just as happy.' Well, as someone that has played video games, I can say that for myself, this is a fundamentally untrue statement. And since we're of the same species, have presumably the same number of working senses and fingers, I feel like I can say the same could potentially be true for him.

Did you really miss the part where OP implied they would in fact like to have sex but it isn't there number 1 priority in order to try and throw back my metaphor in my face? Might just be me.

&gt;Again, maybe not. We wouldn't know until someone tried video games and didn't like them, would we?

I don't support censorship. I am entirely against the politics of the country I live in at the moment (England, what the fuck is happening here), there is A LOT of political opinions flying around here I disagree with. Frankly, censoring those people does more harm than good, because it prevents me from making up my own mind.  


I'm centre-left, politically.

A government that is objectively bad for it's people should absolutely be taken to task for it, and intervening to stop the spread of a valid and in my opinion, much needed, political signalboost will never be seen as a good thing to me.

All of these are monetarily beneficial things. I have my values that I follow, and I consider them grounded.

However, if a company's actions align with something I believe to be morally reprehensible, for whatever reason, I am going to   very much take issue with it.

This is another one of those circumstances, and while it's not identical to the things listed above, it is a matter of money over morals, and that sort of attitude is why most of us have far worse lives than we need to.

I hate the living situation where I am. I cannot imagine the difficulty that HK residents face. No one should be standing in the way of a message supporting them, to do so is immoral.

Even if you did genuinely think so many of these people were rapists, for each alleged rapist there is a rape victim. If you're genuinely suggesting that rapists stem from these environments, then what you are doing is preventing victims from experiencing a better life elsewhere. Your mindset condemns people that you are so quick to judge to further abuse.

People wouldn't do bad things if there weren't so many migrants, right!?

The irony of the OP being about human rights, but the posters being about how foreigners are rapists and shouldn't be allowed near their country. It is completely scaremongering.

You can keep digging mate. I am to this day, awaiting a pro-interaction argument from you, but you're happy to keep sidestepping that, despite it being the entire point of this conversation, because you are a stupid person and you cannot make a cohesive argument.

Here's a challenge for you; next time you reply, make a point relevant to the OP and in favour of the interaction, because so far the conversation has been as follows:

""play around it""

""that's not reasonable, here's an explanation why""

""lol casual casual. I won't actually offer a counterpoint, because I don't have one. Ur a casual legend player which means I win the argument by default??""

Like I said mate, if this is honestly the brainpower you're working with, I really don't think you're in any position to question someone else's playing ability.

Down 15‚Ä?0 with 1:08 remaining, the Browns were forced to try to convert on 4th and 2 at the Jaguars' 12 yard line. Tim Couch took the snap and passed short to Quincy Morgan, who appeared to bobble the ball after a 3 yard gain, but the referees called it a completed pass.

The Hawker Siddeley Nimrod is a maritime patrol aircraft developed and operated by the United Kingdom. It was an extensive modification of the de Havilland Comet, the world's first operational jet airliner. It was originally designed by de Havilland's successor firm, Hawker Siddeley; further development and maintenance work was undertaken by Hawker Siddeley's own successor companies, British Aerospace and BAE Systems, respectively.

Designed in response to a requirement issued by the Royal Air Force (RAF) to replace its fleet of ageing Avro Shackletons, the Nimrod MR1/MR2s were primarily fixed-wing aerial platforms for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations; secondary roles included maritime surveillance and anti-surface warfare.

It is based on rhythmic stepping and the execution of choreographed figures by a group of dancers, usually wearing bell pads on their shins. Implements such as sticks, swords and handkerchiefs may also be wielded by the dancers. In a small number of dances for one or two people, steps are near and across a pair of clay tobacco pipes laid one across the other on the floor.

comment,WikiTextBot,"**FCC fairness doctrine**

The fairness doctrine of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), introduced in 1949, was a policy that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was‚Äîin the FCC's view‚Äîhonest, equitable, and balanced. The FCC eliminated the policy in 1987 and removed the rule that implemented the policy from the Federal Register in August 2011.The fairness doctrine had two basic elements: It required broadcasters to devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. Stations were given wide latitude as to how to provide contrasting views: It could be done through news segments, public affairs shows, or editorials. The doctrine did not require equal time for opposing views but required that contrasting viewpoints be presented.

comment,WikiTextBot,"**Command responsibility**

Command responsibility, sometimes referred to as the Yamashita standard or the Medina standard, and also known as superior responsibility,  is the legal doctrine of hierarchical accountability for war crimes.The term may also be used more broadly to refer to the duty to supervise subordinates, and liability for the failure to do so, both in government, military law, and with regard to corporations and trusts.

The doctrine of ""command responsibility"" was established by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, partly based on the American Lieber code, a war manual for the Union forces signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, and was applied for the first time by the German Supreme Court at the Leipzig War Crimes Trials after World War I, in the 1921 trial of Emil M√ºller.The United States of America confirmed and incorporated the mentioned 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions on ""command responsibility"" into United States federal law through the precedent set by the United States Supreme Court (called the ""Yamashita standard"") in the case of Japanese General Tomoyuki Yamashita. He was prosecuted in 1945 for atrocities committed by troops under his command in the Philippines, in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Yamashita was charged with ""unlawfully disregarding and failing to discharge his duty as a commander to control the acts of members of his command by permitting them to commit war crimes.""Furthermore, the so-called ""Medina standard"" clarified the U.S. law to clearly also encompass U.S. officers, so that those as well as foreign officers such as General Yamashita can be prosecuted in the United States. The ""Medina standard"" is based upon the 1971 prosecution of U.S. Army Captain Ernest Medina in connection with the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War.

comment,WikiTextBot,"**Rommel myth**

The Rommel myth, or the Rommel legend, is a phrase used by a number of historians in reference to common depictions of German field marshal Erwin Rommel as an apolitical, brilliant commander and a victim of Nazi Germany due to his presumed participation in the 20 July plot against Adolf Hitler. According to these historians, who take a critical view of Rommel, such depictions are not accurate.

The myth was created, with Rommel's participation, as a component of Nazi propaganda to praise the Wehrmacht and instil optimism in the German public. Starting in 1941, it was picked up and disseminated in the West by the British war-time press as the Allies sought to explain their continued inability to defeat the Axis forces in North Africa: The genius of Rommel was used by dissenters to protest against social inequality within the British army and by leaders like Churchill to reduce class tensions.Following the war, the Western Allies, and particularly the British, depicted Rommel as the ""good German"" and ""our friend Rommel"", adhering closely to the tenets of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht.

Excerebration is an Egyptian mummification procedure of removal of the brain from corpses prior to actual embalming.  Greek writer Herodotus, a frequent visitor to Egypt wrote in the fifth century B.C. about the process ""Having agreed on a price, the bearers go away, and the workmen, left alone in their place, embalm the body. If they do this in a perfect way, they first draw out part of the brain through the nostrils with an iron hook, and inject certain drugs into the rest"".An object more than 7 inches long probably made from plants in the group Monocotyledon (including palm and bamboo) would have been used for liquefying and removing the brain. The instrument would be inserted through a hole punched into the ethmoid bone near the nose.

It was created not as a cultural activity but as a relief measure to employ artists and artisans to create murals, easel paintings, sculpture, graphic art, posters, photography, theatre scenic design, and arts and crafts. The WPA Federal Art Project established more than 100 community art centers throughout the country, researched and documented American design, commissioned a significant body of public art without restriction to content or subject matter, and sustained some 10,000 artists and craft workers during the Great Depression.

comment,WikiTextBot,"**Correlation does not imply causation**

In statistics, the phrase ""correlation does not imply causation"" refers to the inability to legitimately deduce a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables solely on the basis of an observed association or correlation between them.  The complementary idea that ""correlation implies causation"" is an example of a questionable-cause logical fallacy, in which two events occurring together are taken to have established a cause-and-effect relationship. This fallacy is also known by the Latin phrase cum hoc ergo propter hoc (""with this, therefore because of this""). This differs from the fallacy known as post hoc ergo propter hoc (""after this, therefore because of this""), in which an event following another is seen as a necessary consequence of the former event.

The word play, punch lines, or 'point' they are making does not require you to have experienced it yourself, or even had someone tell you this prior. 

 It's a simple concept, two people married with kids from a time where divorce is heavily frowned upon.  I can see how they would resent/hate each other and in a different time may have divorced.  But it doesn't even take that much thought to get to that concept. Suddenly 'wife hating' material becomes a platform to discuss two disfunctional adults who don't like each other but live together.... sound like the basis for any sitcoms?


I appreciate you were trying to make a point that the right weren't funny until you personally found the choice of material to your liking, it's just a pretty ridiculous one.

It's my first playthrough, so I don't even know what the blessings are yet :)

I heard sleight of hand is maybe good for lifting keys for the better chests, etc., but I dunno. It's possible I could put a few points of sleight of hand (like up to 4, maybe?) on konstanten, bc he has a slight bonus to it, and focus my main character on stealth/mechanics/a little athletics instead? Although that might be a little rough with three pretty big skills on one character. I'm level 6 about to respec bc everyone is spread too thin, and my main character's stealth is bad enough that he basically can't do his job as an assassin, let alone successfully pickpocket, pick locks, or disable traps in neketaka. It just really feels like sleight of hand, stealth, and mechanics should all be on the rogue-y character, and it just doesn't make sense in the game.",f2x6iyl,1570474334,reddit.com/r/projecteternity/comments/den0kv/insight_religion_survival_wicritique_my_party/f2x6iyl/,0

comment,scottyLogJobs,"Not to beat a dead horse, but how many days per week do you drink and how much? Not saying that's what it is, but visceral / belly fat is from large insulin spikes like you get with drinking or high sugar intake, and sometimes we're not the best judge of our own behavior.

Anyway, if it really isn't the drinking, try to really cut back on sugar and carbs, no ice cream and eating pizza and cheeseburgers. Too calorie-dense, easy to lose control.

When you do have them, have them with a lot of vegetables, you want that fiber to slow your digestion to reduce the insulin spike and therefore the visceral fat.

That and a sizeable calorie deficit.

They're messing with the formula, and they've made a mess. It's now infuriatingly slow and tedious to unlock something that used to be a ""jump in and start killing shit with this new thing"" sort of setup.

I think schools can actively turn students away from wanting to read by making it a chore. So many English teachers are over zealous with how fast they want you to finish a book that once they dictate you should be up to a certain point past where you've read I just lose any motivation to finish and they spoil future events.

comment,Kremhild,"One could make the argument that it *could* be bigotry because conservatives can't control it (and I think this view has some merit). These are people so indoctrinated by tradition and bubbled into safe spaces by fear that they *literally* don't have the cognitive processes to even consider the issue, let alone changing their mind. Having hatred to a conservative frothing at the mouth about Her Emails, sJews, or Orange Man Bad is like having hatred at a 40 IQ adult-child having a tantrum and throwing something dangerous at you. Sure, a lot of responses against them and cautionary measures are justified, but these aren't people capable of having responsibility for their actions.

It doesn't mean we give speaking against them the same moral weight as real bigotry. It doesn't mean people are obligated to feel sympathy for them. It doesn't mean we don't hold them accountable. It just means be aware that, for the purpose of political discussion, these are *literally* child-age people in adult bodies.",f35m6c7,1570681851,reddit.com/r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM/comments/dfm5pj/huh_apparently_not_liking_bigots_makes_me_a_bigot/f35m6c7/,0

Tommy (Caster on the right) : You have to speak it clearly. You can go on with the eight words and PD you can end this cut after that. And we'll stop saying anything.

Blizchung : Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times

Tommy (Caster on the right) : PD, make the scene back to us.

Tommy (Caster on the right) : This is fine, right? Is this interview too short?
