I don't really have good words for this. It's really honestly heartbreaking. I've been a Blizzard fan my whole life. Basically since I first gained an awareness of computer games, I've been into Warcraft and Starcraft. I've been a loyal fan, I've bought into the hype, I wanted to work at Blizzard one day--that was my dream job for the longest time.

This latest turn of events is such a blow. Because even though I have loved the company for so long, this crosses a line that I just can't follow.

If you haven't yet watched Lindsay Ellis' incredible three-part analysis on the Hobbit trilogy... This is from [her concluding portion, where she delves into New Zealand litigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi7t_g5QObs) that resulted from labor clashes during the production of *The Hobbit* and its sequels:

&gt;When people ask whether it's moral to separate art from the artist, or in this case, product from the multinational conglomerate, what they're really asking is, ""how can I go back to consuming media like I did when I was a kid? When the most context I had or cared about was who the author of my favorite book was, or why I like this actor, or what Ke$ha's real name and birthday is.""  
&gt;  
&gt;But as an adult, you're expected to be an ethical consumer of media, and it's somewhat inevitable that some people resent that, because consuming media the way children do is comforting. Consuming media like *The Hobbit* as an adult is complicated. And in this day and age it's hard to do so innocently. And I totally understand wanting to return to that innocence. And I don't really have an argument against that worldview other than... that's adulthood.

That's adulthood indeed. I can't ethically consume Blizzard content while they do this. I really, really hope that they turn around and do the right thing. But I can't--really can't--sacrifice my belief in democracy and human rights on the altar of digital entertainment. No can do.

But remember that [controversy can also be a great marketing tool for corporations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06yy88tLWlg).

If you're deleting your cards, and later you feel remorse and want to play HS again, you are effectively paying Blizzard twice for the same cards.  **Don't do that.**  If avoiding that outcome means you don't disenchant your cards, that is the more conscionable thing to do.

It is 100% a good thing to quit Hearthstone due to Blizzard's stance on Hong Kong.  But it is also a reasonable thing to keep playing HS because you enjoy it.  Quitting Hearthstone is not the most important political stand you can take on the Hong Kong issue; Blizzard is not the only corporation that supports the Chinese government's repressive actions, and it is very hard to free yourself from all of them.  It is a systemic issue, not just an issue with Blizzard.  However, quitting Hearthstone might be low-hanging fruit, in which case, go for it!  If you don't quit, I hope you at least look for other avenues of political expression.

All I'm saying is, consider the issue and make the decision you're comfortable with.  If you're looking for other card games, MTGA has a fantastic new-player experience, I don't know about the long-term expense of the game but for the first two weeks it is very fun for zero money, try it out.

Win condition 1: Make money with [Cutpurse](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Cutpurse) &amp; [Tomb Pillager](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Tomb_Pillager
). This money will help you make great deals later on using [Gadgetzan Auctioneer](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Gadgetzan_Auctioneer). It will also help make your [Shadow of death](
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Shadow_of_Death), [Lab recruiters](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Lab_Recruiter) &amp; [Toggwaggle scheme](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Togwaggle%27s_Scheme) easier to play in the middle game.  
&amp;nbsp;



  The main idea of this win condition is simple: Keep copying Tomb pillager and gain infinite money while your opponent watches you bath in coin like Scrooge McDuck. Ideally you can grow your midgame economy indefinitely like this.  
&amp;nbsp;


Win condition 2: The opponent protests your first win condition and refuses to let you be Scrooge McDuck so you have to resort to your second win condition. This is why [Mind control tech](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Mind_Control_Tech) &amp; [Sylvanas](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Sylvanas_Windrunner) is included to take control of their minions and convince your opponent to accept your deck into their heart.
Side note: If necesary, use [Shadow of death](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Shadow_of_Death) (even twice) to summon multiple [Sylvanas](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Sylvanas_Windrunner) to take control of all of your opponents minions to concede them into surrender.  
&amp;nbsp;



Win condition 3: Time to convince your opponent even more. Play [Undatakah](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/90240-da-undatakah). 3x the money from [Tomb Pillager](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Tomb_Pillager
), 3x the mind control from [Sylvanas](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Sylvanas_Windrunner) to show your overwhelming power. Combine with [Toggwaggle scheme](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Togwaggle%27s_Scheme) or [Shadow of death](
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Shadow_of_Death) to oppress your opponent into defeat even more.  
&amp;nbsp;  



Win condition 4: This is the late-game knockout. You should have kept at least 1 coin during the previous win conditions to make stage 4 work, which i call ""overwhelm by numbers"". [NzothÂ¨(https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/N%27Zoth,_the_Corruptor) + coin + [Toggwaggle scheme](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Togwaggle%27s_Scheme). All the coin (Tomb Pillager) and mind control(Sylvanas) will come back instantly and this will force your opponent to concede to your superior tactics.  
&amp;nbsp;  




Now onto some tech i included into this deck:  
Tech 1: This is maybe one of the more brilliant parts of the decks. It doesn't just run 1 silence minion, but 4, including 2 ""[Cheat death](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76866-cheat-death)"" secrets which can result into 6+ silences. This means whatever your opponent plays onto the board that you don't agree with you can just tell it to shut the fuck up, over and over. You might notice that telling a opponent twice or 3 times to stfu might not be enough but after 6 times they start to lose power and will stop resisting.  
&amp;nbsp;  


Tech 1.5: If your opponent isn't showing resistance, the [Cheat death](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76866-cheat-death) secret may of course be used to copy Tomb Pilager into [Lab recruiter](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Lab_Recruiter), resulting in easy coin.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Tech 2: Sometimes silencing your opponents over and over isn't enough. You might have to [Sap](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Sap) them to remove them from contending you. Or when a group of minions challenge you there's 2x [Vanish](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Vanish) in the deck to escape the situation. This is just in case if the situation gets too sticky and you don't feel like dealing with it.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Tech 3: If the game is really slow like against Control priest or warrior, There's some copy effects to make you some cheap factory copies of cards, like [Mimic pod](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/55483-mimic-pod), [Faceless manipulator](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Faceless_Manipulator), [Thistle tea](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Thistle_Tea) &amp; [Zola](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76880-zola-the-gorgon) which will help you copy money cards. These copies sort of resemble original quality and will still help you win the game. Would not recommendend scratching the golden copied zola card, the gold topping may wear off..  
&amp;nbsp;  


Tech 4: [Ironfur Grizzly](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Ironfur_Grizzly). I cannot understate how important this card is. Sometimes on turn 3 you have no defense against a early 2 attack minion and Ironfur acts as a Winnie the Pooh with taunt, soaking all aggression and protecting your life-total. Absolute critical card to include in this deck.
&amp;nbsp;  


I think my money making record with this deck so far is 17 coins.

I'm trying to keep this as unbiased as possible. The intention for this post is not for you to side with or against Blizzard, but rather for you to see what has happend so far, so that you can create your own opinion.

I will be talking about Netease quite a bit during this. This is because Blizzard's games in China are administrated by another company known as Netease, who also manages games like Shadowverse. Is it required by law from the chinese goverment to have a chinese corporation administrate a companys licenses.

\- Grandmaster Blitzchung was banned from attending any Hearthstone tournaments for a year, and has had all his earnings revoked. Furthermore the two taiwanese casters were fired aswell.

\- The reason he was banned, according to Netease and Blizzard was because of he uttered the words 7 words (8 in mandarin) ""Free Hong Kong. Revolution of our times."" This is seen as being a violation of section 6.1 in the Grandmasters competition rules. It states as follows: *Engaging in any act that, in Blizzardâ€™s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the playerâ€™s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzardâ€™s Website Terms. â€?

\- The reason why the casters were fired was because they encouraged Blitzchung to mutter the ""8"" words. \[Source:\]( [https://twitter.com/czhihong/status/1181452540753235971](https://twitter.com/czhihong/status/1181452540753235971))

\- The only thing that Blizzard NA has done so far is to confirm the banning of Blitzchung from Blizzard tournaments. No statements from official Blizzard employees have been given yet on the issue.

\- Accordingly China generates about 5.2% of Blizzards revenue \[Source:\]( [https://www.thestreet.com/technology/china-gaming-activision-take-two-ea-tencent-trade-talks-14889299](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/china-gaming-activision-take-two-ea-tencent-trade-talks-14889299))

\- The interview between Blitzchung and the casters has since been deleted.

\- China has recently also put restrictions on the showing of other forms of western entertainment, including from NBA.

I hope this can be of any use to you. If i have missed something, or any of this information is wrong, please inform me in the comments.

As an avid gamer and upon seeing Blizzard's action towards a Hong Kong Esports player, I wish to share you the origin of the protest and how by core that the protest is unethical. 

As the world knows, the protest is to protect Hong Kong citizens from the extradition bill as it can grant unrestricted apprehension practices from PRC China. However the world seems to be blindsided by why the extradition bill was created in the first place. It started when a 19 years old Hong Kong resident killed his pregnant girlfriend in February 2019, Taiwan, dismembered the body, and put in a luggage bag. The perpetrator then returned to Hong Kong and admitted the crime to the Hong Kong police. Under the current law system, this created a legal loop-hole in which the police were unable to charge the perpetrator for murder due to no extradition law in place between Taiwan and Hong Kong. There was a brief notion of a ""Sunset clause"" to deal with the situation but alas both Hong Kong and Taiwan rejected the notion. On the Taiwan side, the president ""Tsai Ing-wen"" said ""we don't want to be part of China for anything as it violates our freedom"" whereas the chief executive of Hong Kong said ""the sunset clause cannot repair the legal loop-hole of Hong Kong"". As a result of both side failing the reach an agreement, nothing constructive was done. 

Fast track to June in which the first protest began, Hong Kong was already influenced by politicians about the shady practices of PRC China. A good example was the occupy central movement in March 2013. Many citizens, mainly students and young adults of Hong Kong with little knowledge of the world began to show blind hatred towards China by western media. While I don't condone with some of the actions taken by China, I believe it is also unethical and immoral for a murderer to escape justice. In addition, the protest that was originally started as concerns towards the extradition bill has devolved into an anti-China riot which overshadowed the original intention. 

Democracy when done right should be one of many methods to perpetuate mankind to a new golden era. Everyone should listen to all views, invoke critical thinking and walk a path that is ethical, moral and responsible. However, the actions displayed by the rioters of Hong Kong shows no such thinking. They chant democracy but show violence towards people with other views, here are videos illustrating their actions:

These are just some of the videos the world isn't aware of. As of today Youtube continues to suppress their exposure...

Many admit the extradition bill was hastily written but there was absolutely no need for violence to erupt, Hong Kong already has a robust democratic system and a reasonable degree of freedom to iron out any potential hiccups. As of 2019, Hong Kong is still the free-est city of the world according to ""[https://www.heritage.org/index/](https://www.heritage.org/index/)"". Alas thanks to the action of our retards, we are having democracy run by stupidity and now idiot tyranny runs supreme.

In conclusion, families in Hong Kong today are fractured and long time friendships were broken. Political extremism has taken root in Hong Kong. As a politically neutral citizen of Hong Kong and an avid gamer, it is now even grimmer as my peers in the gaming world turning on each other in a crumpling society. Children as young as 12 years old are even talked into rioting. Returning to the main point, because of the anti-China movement around the world, a murderer gets away and Hong Kong citizen can now freely murder in Taiwan (if you escape to Hong Kong). As this whole endeavor continues, the murderer can be free as of October 2019.  I will end this message with 2 questions:

What is freedom without ethics, moral and responsibility? Do mankind deserve such privilege?

Here's a pic of the murderer, victim and the baby inside her, may justice finds its way..

    This email is addressed whomever is in charge of data protection for your company. I am a customer of yours, and in light of recent events, I am making this request for access to personal data pursuant to Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation. Your recent action punishing a customer for expressing support for the victims of the human rights abuses of the regime in China was disgraceful. I cannot comprehend how anyone can be so unscrupulous that they are willing to support a regime currently commiting a genocide in the blind and uncompromising pursuit of profits. This uncompromising pursuit of profit also puts into question your willingness to protect my rights as a customer, since it may very well be the case that protecting those rights will impact your profits negatively. Specifically, your recent actions and lack of morals gives me reason to be concerned that:
    
    1. You might be profiteering off of my personal data by selling and/or sharing the data with other entities, in particular Chinese entities.
    2. You might be using my personal data in ways that are not in my best interest.

FearlessHS,t2_2ipxfuz6,1570636589,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfj139/brian_kiblers_thoughts_on_blitzchung/,dfj139,TRUE,FALSE,10,0,45,"Link to the original post: http://bmkgaming.com/statement-on-blitzchung/

""I certainly never expected that my position in the Hearthstone community would lead to me making a statement on sensitive topics regarding international relations, but I have always viewed my strange place as a public figure in gaming as an opportunity to try to make the world a better place in whatever way I can, so here we are.

Here are the facts as I understand them.

After finishing his final match of the second season of the Asia-Pacific Hearthstone Grandmasters, Hong Kong player Ng â€œblitzchungâ€?Wai Chung appeared on the official Taiwanese Hearthstone stream for his post-game interview wearing a gas mask. He lifted the mouthpiece and shouted, in Chinese: â€œLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!â€?â€?a rallying cry of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.

On Tuesday, Blizzard announced their ruling, claiming that Blitzchung violated one of the Hearthstone Grandmasters rules against â€œengaging in any act that, in Blizzardâ€™s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.â€?
The penalty they imposed was expelling Blitzchung from the Grandmasters league entirely, including retroactively revoking the prize money he had earned throughout the season, and additionally banning him from competing in events for a year. They also announced that they would no longer work with the casters involved in the controversial interview.

I want to start by saying that I feel what Blitzchung did was very brave. He knew that his actions would likely have serious consequences, not just for his future in Hearthstone but possibly even for his personal safety, and I commend him for the fortitude that takes.

Even so, I do think that Blizzard was correct in issuing him a penalty for his actions. They do not want to set the precedent for their official broadcasts being used as political tools. The players agreed to particular rules for behavior, and he violated those rules.

I have seen many descriptions of the situation claim that Blizzard took action against Blitzchung â€œfor his support of the Hong Kong protestsâ€? but thatâ€™s not an entirely accurate description. They did not penalize him for his political stance â€?they penalized him for breaking the rules by using their official broadcast to promote that stance.

Anyone who pays attention to my social media feeds knows that I am not someone who shies away from politics. I am frequently quite vocal about my views about whatâ€™s going on in the United States. I have kept a deck titled â€œElection 2016â€?in my collection for the past three years, full of cards like Corruption, DOOM, and Validated Doomsayer. I would rather risk alienating those who disagree with me rather than stay silent on matters I consider important.

But when I am on the desk for an official Hearthstone broadcast, I leave those views at home. Maybe Iâ€™ll make a subtle snide remark on occasion, but I know that I am representing Blizzard in addition to myself. If I were to close a show with speech about how I feel like Trump should be impeached, I wouldnâ€™t expect to be invited back for future events.

All that having been said, there are additional factors at play here. The punishment meted out to Blitzchung is incredibly harsh. I could understand a fine, or even a short suspension from competitive play, but removal from Grandmasters, clawing back the prizes he already earned, and banning him for a full year seems completely overboard to an extent that feels completely unwarranted and unfair.

I wonâ€™t pretend to understand either the intricacies of the geopolitical situation in China and Hong Kong or the full extent of Blizzardâ€™s business interests there, but to me this penalty feels like it is deeply rooted in both. The heavy-handedness of it feels like someone insisted that Blizzard make an example of Blitzchung, not only to discourage others from similar acts in the future but also to appease those upset by the outburst itself.

That kind of appeasement is simply not something I can in good conscience be associated with. When I learned about the ruling, I reached out to Blizzard and informed them that I no longer feel comfortable casting the Grandmasters finals at BlizzCon. I will not be a smiling face on camera that tacitly endorses this decision. Unless something changes, I will have no involvement in Grandmasters moving forward.

However, I want to make clear that not everyone involved in GM has this luxury. Do not take your anger out on the other casters, or streamers, or employees of Blizzard. This is not the kind of decision that comes from the rank and file. Most likely theyâ€™re just as angry as you are. I know I am.""",hearthstone,Brian Kibler's thoughts on Blitzchung,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfj139/brian_kiblers_thoughts_on_blitzchung/,,

With the recent Kibler statement, I think itâ€™s important that we unite together to protect everyone from the possible abuse people may encounter for standing up for what they believe in.*

I hope that all Esports players take a stand against this blatant cowardly abuse. Without you all, there is no Esports scene. Many of you are probably scared of taking a stance, you have your reasons and we understand, but that's what they are counting on. The Esports scene is still new and fresh, and they want to take advantage of you. You all have a bargaining chip, and you can all use it. Please remember that these companies do not care about you. We the players have given unprecedented support to you all to give you the chance of playing in the big leagues. From watching you all as streamers, to donating and subscribing to you all, and to giving money to the organizations and teams you represent. Take a stand, support your fellow Esport players, form a union and protect your rights. Protest and condemn the actions of the companies in charge of your game!



A large number of games are currently owned by China backed companies, [here](https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/) is a list of gaming companies Tencent, a Chinese conglomerate has invested in. Here are a few notable ones:


* Riot Games (League of Legends) - 100%
* Epic Games (Fortnite) - 48.4%
* Bluehole (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) 11.5%
* Activision Blizzard (Hearthstone/Overwatch/World of Warcraft) - 5%

&amp;#x200B;

Itâ€™s worth noting for background that Activision works with NetEase, another Chinese gaming conglomerate to manage its games in China, which actively censors and removes anything that China isnâ€™t okay with. They are also developing the mobile port of Diablo Immortals, a game they planned on introducing to China, but marketed it towards the rest of the world and it failed spectacularly. We were never the intended target audience for the game.


What Blizzard has done to Blitzchung shows how easily your livelihoods can be ruined in an instant. They withheld his winnings and have swiftly banned him from competing in any Hearthstone related Esport event. I and many others will not support this behavior. We support the Esport players willing to stand with us and fight against oppression.

This app would have 100% been banned in the US too. Or my own country (NL), for that matter.


Same actually applies to the Blizzard situation as I pointed out [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df1ai0/playing_the_devils_advocate_is_all_this/). Kibbler actually put out a statement confirming that point: They agree it's brave of him to sacrifice his own personal security to make such a political statement. In fact, Kibbler [literally said](http://bmkgaming.com/statement-on-blitzchung/): 

&gt; I want to start by saying that I feel what Blitzchung did was very brave. He knew that his actions would likely have serious consequences, not just for his future in Hearthstone but possibly even for his personal safety, and I commend him for the fortitude that takes.
Even so, I do think that Blizzard was correct in issuing him a penalty for his actions. They do not want to set the precedent for their official broadcasts being used as political tools. The players agreed to particular rules for behavior, and he violated those rules.


But all of Reddit is acting as if the player/casters didn't know beforehand that they had signed an agreement clause that pretty much says **""Do not bring politics to our worldwide stream""**. They knew, they chose to break the rule anyway to put the message out there, but don't act as if they didn't know the consequences! 

## The Blizzard ban had nothing to do with the casters getting political *about China*, but with *getting political at all.* Same as that this ban on this app has nothing to do with tracking police *in China* but *tracking police at all*.


If that frontpage article about apple had read 'App that tracks Police banned in Detroit' it'd have 30 Golds and a lot of praise mmurica!'s


I mean it's a terrible fucking situation and I definitely fucking hate the Chinese government, but you're getting mad at the wrong people!

You wanna be mad at the right people? Go be mad at the fucking **sponsors.** THEY are the ones who'd back out of sponsoring if Blizzard *didn't* enforce the clause the Player and Casters signed.

I do not condone the actions Activision Blizzard took in this scenario. I do not condone the smug, egotistical comments over the years to the fans, such as \[""You think you do, but you don't""\]([https://youtu.be/0Wrw3c2NjeE](https://youtu.be/0Wrw3c2NjeE)) and \[""Do you guys not have phones?""\]([https://youtu.be/MmkHAlhCvWg](https://youtu.be/MmkHAlhCvWg)). With that being said, I will still play Blizzard games, I will keep my subscription to World of Warcraft.

**Why?**

The quick answer: To support the game designers, artists, coders, quest designers, software engineers, network reliability engineers, and all the other positions in that company. \[Wikipedia: Activision Blizzard\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision\_Blizzard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard)) states 9,900 employees as of 2018. The actions of Blizzard concerning the Hearthstone/Honk Kong PR nightmare does not come from 99.9% of the company. It's the .1%, the top brass that made this decision. I know the knee-jerk reaction is to completely distance yourselves from the company as a whole. Terminate all further payments to Blizzard. Show no support to them. What concerns me, is how the brass would react to seeing their stocks fall. When things of this nature happen, two main choices are considered: Fix the narrative and apologize or look at ways to circumvent the lost income. Would Blizzard take the first option? Given their past blunders and aftermath of those events, I don't see Blizzard really doing this. The leaves the second option. How would Blizzard circumvent lost income? Downsizing. Employees, who don't all share in the views of their company, would be let go and left to find other employment. Tweets have been posted by some employees, showing their support of Blitzchung and showing they do not endorse their employers decision. While many would say these employees should quit, it's not always financially practical for these choices to be made. Many employees depend on this income for various reasons. Many are not in that comfortable spot to be able to walk away, and so they stay, doing their jobs and continuing to provide quality entertainment to us while dealing with backlash from the choices of those that run their company. 

There are other ways to show support for Blitzchung, to show support for Hong Kong. Don't participate in tourneys involving Blizzard games. The Mythic Dungeon invitational, the Hearthstone tourneys, the WoW Arena Championships...don't participate, don't watch them. Leave those areas empty during BlizzCon. There are many more ways to voice your support. I just ask you fully consider how you choose to do this. I fear we would punish those who have no say in their companies decisions.

And I told everyone to have fun, but don't be political and don't piss off others.  Then you came alone, started bashing Trump and drove half of my friends to leave.  Even if I agree with your view, I'd still want to kick you out of my house.

A lot people think Blitzchung's action was ""brave"".  Maybe it was brave, but it was also selfish.  His action forced Blizzard to be in a position that they don't want to be in order to execute his own political agenda.  As a company, Blizzard does not wish to participate in this debate and it does not wish to take a stand.  Blitzchung does not care what his action will cost Blizzard and ignored the rule he agreed with.  

As for the casters, they tried to spin off this situation as they were protecting freedom of speech by saying ""he earned his interview"".  But winning a match and earning an interview doesn't come with a get out of jail free card that allows you to ignore the rule you agreed with.  In addition, the casters promoted Blitzchung to say the protesting slogan.

Had Blitzchung post his speech on his own twitter or other news interview and Blizzard punished him for that, I would be totally pissed off just like the majority of this sub.

However, this whole situation has nothing to do with freedom of speech but simply an action was taken according to the rule book and an unfortunate event that Blizzard tried to avoid by listing in the rule book.  

Please also let me get something out of my chest.  This is just my feeling and I can't represent anyone else other than myself.

I have been reading this sub for the past couple days.  As a Chinese American, I can't shake this feeling that in this sub, ""Every voice matters, except if you are Chinese and trying to say something pro-China, because you must be brainwashed and your voice doesn't matter.""  God forbid if a Chinese person trying to be patriotic because he must be manipulate by the Chinese government.  God forbid if a Chinese person post something pro-China or pro-Blizzard on Chinese Twitter, Weibo, that person must be trying to score some ""social credit points"".  God forbid if someone tries to post about HK riot, that person must be ignorance because those information must be untrue and must be coming from Chinese propaganda.

I (and I hope people who like me) don't think or act that way.  I'm not someone who doesn't know anything else.  My friends and I (and a lot of them are in China) read both sides of story, from protesters' demands to some protesters riot actions.  The whole HK situation deserves its own debate which I don't want to get in too much details.  But let me share with you guys some misunderstanding that I have been feeling when reading other posts.  (This is my thought and it can be biased).  1) Chinese people don't have issue with others criticizing CPP, just like how Americans criticizes Democrats or Republicans.  2) Chinese people don't have issue with others criticizing their government.  They may disagree, but it is okay to criticize.  3) What Chinese people don't like is when others curse China or Chinese people.  I know a lot of times when we curse China we really meant Chinese government.  4) What really piss Chinese people off is the Separatism that others trying to split China apart.  I know the current HK movement is not about separatism so they don't have problem with this.  5) Currently, Chinese people don't have issue with the ""protest"", because that's their rights, even though they may disagree with the protesters .  (fun fact, it is a rights also allowed by the Chinese government after 1997 when HK was handover back to China.  Prior to that the British doesn't allow them to protest.)  They only have problem with the people who are rioting in the name of protesting/freedom fighting and perform assault/sexual assault/vandalization and other crimes.  

In the end, I just want to share this short ""propaganda"" video about a 70 yrs old grandma tells you what she sees in HK.  You can be the judge and see how the ""peaceful protesters"" used laser pen to point her eyes and how they tried to hand her a Chinese flag to frame her as patriotic to China.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPYuGYLesx0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPYuGYLesx0)

I know that most people on this subreddit also don't actually care about Chinese oppression or actual videogames for that matter, because Devotion came out this year, is one of the best games of this year or any year, and there was nowhere nearly as much outrage about China getting the game canceled and directly endangering the lives and wellbeing of the developers and publishers of that game. You can no longer buy Devotion due to sheer and direct Chinese oppression, yet I can't imagine anyone here caring about that, or anything else besides Hearthstone and whatever Blizzard does. Regardless, you seem to all be doing a really good job of pretending to care, since nobody is calling anybody out on anything and that usually means a political movement is doing well.

I know there are plenty of reasons to stop playing Hearthstone, even though I've spent $1400 on it [proof](https://imgur.com/a/1N1KytK), such as the game being the most simplistic and least skill-testing of just about any digital card game, as well as relying extensively on psychological hooks like daily quests into enslaving its playerbase into playing when they wouldn't actually want to otherwise, but I'm peachy with those things which is why I keep playing it.

I will start by thanking Blitzchung for his brave actions.  I am a first-generation American working as a Civil Engineer and Farmer.  I regularly see the world through the Climate Crisis.  It looks grim. Real grim. And being a millennial, I play video games with my family and friends to escape (itâ€™s like watching football).  I became a â€œgamerâ€?when I bought my first game, Warcraft III.  My brother and I werenâ€™t allowed to buy it but we did still.  We knew our parents were wrong and that it would not brainwash us - it was nothing like Hamtaro and certainly not Halloween (donâ€™t worry, my parents figured it out later.)  I ended up gaining so much more than a CD.

But because of the actions of China and others who are actively destroying democracy, many families like mine cannot enjoy this luxury.  I mean for goodness sake; people are getting shot at point black range.  Ideological cleansing of millions of Uyghurs.  Rumors and horrific stories of organ harvesting and social credit scores.  As a global world we must stand together and fight these atrocities.

This is why I am not a â€œgamer rising upâ€? as I have seen in the news.  I am a random dude with two jobs and little income who is sick and tired of seeing this world go to shit.  This is may stand, here and now.  If I protest, I will lose my livelihood but if I stop playing Blizzard-Activation games I will just find something else to do.

So Reddit I beg you.  Please welcome **real** capitalism to this planet and join me in boycotting Blizzard-Activision and many other organizations (such as the NBA) that are actively supporting the death of fellow humans.

During times of controversy, /r/Blizzard gets a sizable influx of users and posts as you may remember from last Blizzcon. This comes with a lot of spam, rule-breaking, off-topic, and low-effort content. At the same time, we take great care to avoid censoring sensible discussion. As such, all discussions relating to the aforementioned situation will go in this megathread for now.

**It should go without saying that any witch-hunting, doxxing, and personal threats are against site rules and are still bannable offenses. We are grateful for all our decent users, and everyone who reports rule-breaking posts/comments.**


*Finally, a note on the short time the subreddit was private:* For some reason, one of our recent mods set the subreddit to private then deleted his account. It was an odd event, but rest assured, us remaining mods have restored it to public. No, we were not contacted by Blizzard, nor are we employees to any extent. We are committed to supporting this community. Thanks!

The violent attack sanctioned on the people of Hong Kong by the Chinese Government has been continuing for March, April, May, June, July, August, September and October ( Yeah, maybe if we read each month out loud, we'd realise how long it has been). Banning face masks? Are you kidding me !

USA has expressed concern about the situation in Kashmir (which is good, but with no results) but why hasn't a single US lawmaker even mentioned Hong Kong? Where is UN? Where is Human Rights? Pakistan keeps crying about Kashmir but why are they silent about China? Because China is their ally?

Does Democracy mean forcing the people to pick up arms to fight for their Human Rights and forcing the police to use arms against their own people by the Ruling to enforce their annexation agendas? Shouldn't their concern be more in letting Humans live than clamping down on them, suffocating Humans?

What's going on with the World? Russia annexing Crimea, India forcefully occupying disputed Kashmir, UK desperately trying for Brexit, USA building the wall, China forcing itself on Hong Kong. Is this a starter for Globalist or New World Order agendas that we are not recognizing?

Why is the rest of the World just watching? Does borders between countries differentiate on Human species as well? Aren't the people of Hong Kong, the muslims of Xinjiang Humans too, brothers to you too? Have the term ""Human Rights"" been used so much with less value or action, now become a term that sounds ""Alien"" to us Humans? Human Rights - Basic Rights for Humans living on this planet.

You reading this, couldn't this have happened to you too if fate had you born in Hong Kong?

Are you thinking now that you understand the situation but what can you do about it as a Human? That, you as a single person is helpless to contribute to the situation?

Do you have a Facebook, Instagram, Twitter account and whatever new social media is out there?  No matter where you are, whichever country you are in, couldn't you give a shout out for your fellow Humans in Hong Kong, the chained Muslims in concentration camps of Xinjiang merely fighting for their Human Rights?

Now don't start moaning and crying about, why did you say that about India? or USA or UK or Russia? Rise above Borders. Think, as Humans.

This is the Call To Action : 

**Let millions of individual social media accounts overpower, make resounding noise, put pressure on the Ruling. Because the Corrupt Corporate Paid Media won't do this. Post your status. Post your story.**

I took the time to write this not because I feed on Upvotes for dinner. Cause I feel. I feel for us Humans, like you probably do too. If you are not yet feeling it yet, go read about what's happening in Hong Kong, Xinjiang from different sources and try to picture the situation for yourself. 

Don't share this Reddit post. If you must and don't have the time or knowledge to write something new in your own words, then copy the text. Post your status. Post your story.

Feel free to remove if it is. I just didn't know where else I could post this to raise attention to the issue.

So as we all know, the amount of ""china censorship affecting the west"" stories are blowing up. You got the [NBA](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/opinion/nba-china-hong-kong.html), you got [Hearthstone](https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1181065339230130181?s=19), etc. 

While posts like this are getting attention across a lot of subreddits, I personally noticed that many were disappearing. I'd reply to one, then it would vanish.

Then I stumbled across this post about South Park being banned in China, and I posted it to /r/nottheonion:

[â€˜South Parkâ€?banned in China after mocking Chinese government censors](https://old.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/dertxj/south_park_banned_in_china_after_mocking_chinese/)

It quickly became the top post on the sub. Then, it disappeared. Here is why this is concerning:

- My post didn't break any of the sub rules (they don't have a no politics rule, or anything)
- It wasn't removed, it was ""shadow removed."" Meaning, when I go to /r/nottheonion, I still see it as the top post. If you go, it won't be there.
- There was no actual removal notice for the post
- I reached out the mods to see what the issue is, and they've ignored me.

This suggests that it wasn't ""normal moderation."" They hoped to silence the post without me noticing. 

Of course with [Tencent buying a stake in Reddit](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/08/tencent-invests-social-platform-reddit.aspx), there has been some concern about admins potentially being asked to remove anti-china posts.

Now, I don't have enough evidence to say for sure this is happening, but I have personally seen enough posts removed for no reason to be concern, including my own on /r/nottheonion, which was shadow removed.

Watching the people you love  get murdered in front of you. Watching your city, once a shining beacon of freedom, get burned down. Watching all your basic freedoms evaporate.  

Part of being a hero is standing up for what's right, not your best interests. I am not a hero,  but I will do everything in my power to support those that are on the streets fighting for their democracy everyday.

For this reason, we will be removing all Blizzard affiliated rewards from our app, [Hero Trainer](https://hero-trainer.com).  I have personally uninstalled Battle.net and all Blizzard games. While we are small startup and doubt this will make any substantial impact, it is the right thing to do.

Translation:

Today at 13:08 came news that 26 of those arrested on 6/10 were to be charged with ""violent crime"", 14 of which were also charged with ""illegal use of face masks"". Their case was to be heard at 14:30 at West Kowloon court.

When my friend received the news, he bolted out. By the time he arrived, it was 2:30. There were only 10 family members there. I seems they were also not given much prior notice.

The prosecutors were also themselves late.  We all waited until 15:30 before we were informed that court will be in session at 17:00. Then at 17:30, the prosecution said they weren't ready and can only begin at 18:00. Their family and the public had to wait a total of 4 hours.

For some as respectful as the justice system to be toyed with by the police in this way, can that be considered contempt of court?

Arriving straight to court after work, this was my first time at a hearing. Seeing the many young faces behind the defendants chair, that type of feeling, is far stronger than seeing the same scene on the news.

A 16 year old high school student, because they were carrying a ping pong ball, which the police suspected to contain smoke, was charged with carrying a smoke bomb.

A defendant requested that they be allowed to go to Japan in November, because they had already booked a trip 6 months ago to take their wedding photo. They were due to be married soon...

A male defendant, is the only male in a single parent family who needs to pick up their mother from work all the time. So they applied for their curfew to be waived.

A defendant was a late twenties social worker with a bright future ahead

Three defendants in 4th, 5th and 6th year of high school, did not resist when being arrested. Two of them were struck in the head by police and taken to hospital. The third was struck in the shoulder. They were also taken to hospital.

One of the arrested, when they were arrested dropped a lens on their glasses. they asked the police to help retrieve it for them. The officer stepped on the lens, shattering it, then said ""now you don't have to worry about picking it up""

As I listened, I could feel my tears fall...

Hong Kongers, we must win, because if we lose, then we will lose an entire generation, and fail the many youth in our society...

Business Hall of Bootlickers:

* Activision Blizzard: [banned player](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/dexeva/blizzard_banned_and_took_player_off_air_after_his/) for supporting Hong Kong democracy protest. Confiscated all his winnings. Fired the 2 casters who interviewed him.

* Disney / ESPN: [forbids](https://deadspin.com/internal-memo-espn-forbids-discussion-of-chinese-polit-1838881032) any mention of Chinese politics when discussing Rockets manager's tweet supporting HK freedom.

Per the movie's screenwriter: ""*if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that heâ€™s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people who think that thatâ€™s bullshit*"". Now you can't even acknowledge that Tibet is a place lest our Chinese overlord be displeased.

* ASICS, Calvin Klein, Coach, Fresh, Givenchy, Pocari Sweat, Valentino, Versace, Swarovski: details [here](https://www.whatsonweibo.com/these-are-the-foreign-brands-apologizing-to-china-amid-hong-kong-tensions/)

* Apple: [handed over](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security) iCloud data and encryption keys to China

* Riot Games: [censors](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/dfcjqa/riot_games_owned_100_by_tencent_chinese/) the words ""Hong Kong"", forcing their casters to refer to the team ""Hong Kong Attitude"" as ""HKA"".

* Cathay Pacific: [fired](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/cathay-pacific-denounced-for-firing-hong-kong-staff-on-china-orders) large number of employees for supporting HK democracy protests. Its flight attendants union head was fired for posting on Facebook in support of the protests

* Apple: [minimized](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20853393/apple-iphone-ios-exploits-statement-security-google-false-impressions) the seriousness of iOS exploits that enabled China to track Uyghurs, when over a million of them are already rounded up by China in concentration camps

* Google: [censored](https://lihkg.com/thread/1639291/page/1) pro-HK democracy game ""[The Revolution of Our Times](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=story.hk.hkmovement&amp;hl=en_US)"" from Google Play because it was about a ""*sensitive event*"".

* Tiffany: [removed](https://news.yahoo.com/tiffany-removes-advert-over-hong-kong-controversy-093418861.html) tweet showing a model covering one eye after Chinese consumers accused it of supporting Hong Kong protesters &amp; ""defaming"" China

* Marriott: [fired](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2128124/marriott-sacks-employee-who-liked-twitter-post-tibet-independence) employee who liked tweet from an Tibetan group

After decades of opening up wide the Western market to China while turning a blind eye to rampant Chinese IP thefts, forced tech transfers, and protectionism, we are looking at widespread control of Western businesses by China. Businesses that are not under outright Chinese control are still kowtowing to China out of sheer fear of China's retaliation.

This is just a very incomplete list of what we're seeing publicly. Imagine how bad it really is behind closed doors.

Hide the heart of who we are.   
Making peace to build our future,   
Strong, united, working 'till we fall.  

  
And we all lift, and we're all adrift together, together.   
Through the cold mist, 'till we're lifeless together, together.

Though my cause is kind of outdated it seems, I still wanted to share it with you all.)

Hello, I am u/MaTPheW_FunG, a Redditor from Hong Kong. Posts on this subreddit had mostly been videos and pictures. However, this one will mainly be texts illustrating what I and some of us really think beyond the graphics. I would really appreciate if you took it to your heart and read until the end.

I recently noticed the general opinion of Redditors regarding the Hong Kong protests has been backsliding. This movement was never just butterflies and roses like some have portrayed so. In the same sense, there werenâ€™t only arson, destruction and bloodshed. Thatâ€™s why I am here to try to clarify and shed light on the current circumstances - what the police, our government, and the protesters have done, no matter the good or the bad, I will and only will state the facts. But donâ€™t just hear from me, hear from other news sources too - I have included links of some related reports.

My guess is that many of you started to follow this movement closely after the one-million-march on the 9th of June. The protests at that time, in general, went on peacefully, but even when â…?of the whole city marched for the sole demand of withdrawing the Extradition Law Amendment Bill, our Chief Executive Carrie Lam did not comply. The 12th of June marked the tipping point of the whole movement, as it was the first occasion that rubber and beanbag rounds are used against protesters in an attempt to press forward the council meetings and pass the bill. Later protests often escalate into fierce battles between the riot police and the protesters, and we have yet to see the end.

It remains controversial among protesters about the violent acts around the city. Since foreign news sources could never reach the level of detail in local news, graphics played a very important role in conveying the messages behind the protests, which some, admittingly, is not very pretty to look at, and some media started to give harsh comments on the movement. Yet, the graphics itself is the bare surface of whatâ€™s going on. The message that I am trying to get across is, we ought to understand the motives behind these destructions - what radicalized our peaceful protests?

The populous march on June 9th and 16th proved that there was a lot of public concern over the extradition law amendment, and hence a serious, thorough public consultation was urgently needed, even if a complete withdrawal is not granted at once. Yet, we had only received indifference from the government when expressing our demands through peaceful demonstrations. We are therefore stuck in a dilemma - either we radicalize our actions to add up the pressure to the government in the risk of losing foreign support, or be continuously ignored. What changed the mindset of most protesters is the fact that only through violent means could we halt the lawmaking process, namely on [the protests on 12th of June](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3014104/thousands-block-roads-downtown-hong-kong-defiant-protest) and especially [the vandalism in the Legislative Council on the 1st of July](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-extradition/hong-kong-protesters-smash-up-legislature-in-direct-challenge-to-china-idUSKCN1TV0YE). Lacking cards to play, mounting violence eventually became the only out in many eyes of Hong Kongers.

Snapback to the most recent incidents, most noticeably the assaults on â€œnormal citizensâ€? arsons and destruction of different shops and metro stations. While we recognise these actions are wrong in nature, the context is key to understand their cause: The driver [drove a car into a crowd of protesters before being assaulted](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2019/10/06/hong-kong-taxi-driver-beaten-vpx.cnn); the so-called â€œnormal citizensâ€?are [elite police squads undercover](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/world/hong-kong-police-protests.html); MTR, the company that runs Hong Kongâ€™s metro services, are criticised of being unable to stop the assaults on the 21st of July. Further resentment is ensured as the company turned a blind eye on the police brutality occurred in Prince Edward station on the 31st of August. Later on, the company succumbed to the police even more, including closing down stations on-demand, trains being requisitioned as transport for riot police, and allowing ambush to take place in metro station exits.

No matter what aforementioned, we are deeply sorry for any inconvenience caused at Hong Kong Airport. In case you donâ€™t know, the Hong Kong Airport is one of the busiest airports around the world and it remains largely significant to Hong Kongâ€™s economy. Many of you who travelled to Hong Kong a few months ago may notice that some protests took place in it. Some protesters demonstrate by doing a sit-in, some radical ones took it one step further and started obstructing travellers from entering the departure hall. Protesters took the protests to the airport in hopes of gaining international support and attention as well as bringing pressure to the government. For this please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused.

Another public outrage most recently inflicted is the freshly enacted anti-mask law, put in force by citing the Emergency Regulations Ordinance; and to say it is controversial would be an understatement. Enacted in 1929, it was originally passed to handle a mass strike and has long been forgotten since its last citation in the 1967 riot. Basically, it empowers the Chief Executive to â€œmake any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interestâ€?in â€œan occasion of emergency or public dangerâ€? This recent enactment has caused widespread doubt on its legality and its necessity and was also termed as â€˜madnessâ€?by Chris Patten, the last Governor of HK from 1992-1997. The imposition further deprives Hong Kongâ€™s rule of law and separation of powers and exacerbates the use of institutional violence against protesters and citizens. More worry that imposing this law in such sensitive times will further escalate public dissent.

Thatâ€™s all I wanted to clear up. As I have mentioned, Hong Kong is in desperate need of foreign support, please continue to voice out for Hong Kong, and urge the passing of the Hong Kong Human rights and Democracy Act.

After decades of opening up Western market to China while turning a blind eye to rampant Chinese IP thefts, forced tech transfers, &amp; protectionism, we are looking at widespread control of Western firms by China. Firms that are not under outright Chinese control still kowtow to China out of fear of China's retaliation.

This is a very incomplete list of what we're seeing publicly. Imagine how bad it is behind closed doors.

Simple, easy, and to the point. Everyone who's in favor of the Blizzard boycott? Sign the petition. Let's gatherÂ *as many* people as we can in one collective place, and show how many of us areÂ *really*Â willing to ditch Blizzard and all their products. [Here's a guide](https://imgur.com/gallery/P3Bd5c0).  


By signing this petition, you're supporting:  
\- The uninstalling of all Blizzard games/your Battle.net client  
\- The boycotting of purchasing Blizzard's products &amp; services  
\- The Hong Kong Protests &amp; our boy Blitzchung

For me, and a lot of Americans, Hong Kong seems like a very distant, obscure issue. I only follow it because I have a good friend from there. But I think that the Chinese mightâ€™ve stepped on a massive landmine with the nba controversy. Americans are being censored by the Chinese government in Washington DC; thatâ€™s going to be a massive wake-up call that Chinaâ€™s ambitions for hegemony and control go far beyond its own citizens and borders. They somehow managed to unite ted Cruz and AOC against them, and I think awareness will only spread further as China cracks down on more companies.

And yet, game publisher Blizzard did exactly that after Hong Kong-based pro gamer Blitzchung advocated for his own political freedom during a livestream. 

While some companies like Blizzard have shown a willingness to censor your free speech, other companies like Epic have [pledged to support](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906110/blizzard-hearthstone-ban-hong-kong-china-epic-games-fortnite-blitzchung) the rights of their customers, employees, and fans around the world. Now we're keeping score.

We need to get every game company on the record stating whether they do or do not support free speech, and if they will allow their players to advocate for their own freedom. Our new site makes it easy for you to tweet at every major game publisher, and tell them to take a position. It also shows where the companies stand on free speech.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49983767](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49983767)


Broken glass, raging fires, and smashed up barricades: the pictures from Hong Kong in the past few days look like random chaos.

But in the middle of the violence, most activists are being deliberate about the places they attack.

So why are protesters targeting Starbucks? And the metro? And certain shops, restaurants and banks?

There are obvious targets...

Hong Kong is complex, but can largely be divided into those who support the protesters and their anti-Beijing stance, and those supportive of the mainland.

So when peaceful protests turned into violence against property, big mainland firms like Bank of China and tech company Xiaomi became targets for vandalism and spray-painting.

But other less-obvious places are also in the firing line.

Why Starbucks?

While Starbucks may be a US brand, the Hong Kong franchise it is operated by a local company, Maxim's Caterers.

Annie Wu, the daughter of the Maxim Group's founder, recently defended Hong Kong's police and criticised activists as ""radical protesters"".

She made her comments with billionaire businesswoman Pansy Ho, representing the Hong Kong Federation of Women, at the United Nations Human Rights Council on 11 September.

The two criticised ""a small group of radical protesters"" using ""systematic and calculated violent acts"".

So protesters started directing their anger against Maxim's and the franchises it operates.

The restaurant group is one of Hong Kong's largest, and includes other brands such as Genki Sushi and Arome bakery, which have also been targeted.

Maxim's Caterers issued a statement saying Ms Wu ""does not hold any position at the company"" and was not involved in managerial decisions - but so far this has failed to satisfy protesters.

Hong Kong protests - key facts

1. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China, so has some autonomy and people have more rights

2. Protests started in June against a controversial law which would have allowed Hong Kong criminal suspects to be sent to China to stand trial

3. The law has been withdrawn but protests have widened to demand full democracy

4. Clashes between police and activists have been becoming increasingly violent

5. In October, the city banned all face masks to try to shut down the protests

Japanese fast food chain Yoshinoya has also come into the crosshairs.

After there was confusion about a Facebook post - which some read as coded criticism of police - the operator of the Hong Kong franchise said he supported the police and government.

Before long, Yoshinoya restaurants had their windows smashed and graffiti all over their walls.

Are triads involved?

Another targeted brand is Best Mart 360, a chain of small grocery stores. It's an example of the divisions running within the Hong Kong population.

The boss of Best Mart 360 is Hugo Lam Chi-fung, permanent honorary president of the Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations which has held several demonstrations in support of China.

Fujian is a Chinese province, from where many people have emigrated to Hong Kong over the years. Hong Kong's Fujianese community has been vocal in supporting the city's police force.

Those demonstrations have led to clashes with activists - who have accused their opponents of being part of the Fujian triad gangs, a form of organised crime.

Best Mart 360 has released several statements, insisting it is not linked to any Fujian triad.

The triad allegation has also been levelled against a mahjong house in a part of town home to the Fujianese community. Mahjong is a Chinese tile game, played socially.

The Yi Pei Square house was accused of hiding pro-Beijing thugs who attacked local residents.

The parlour has released a statement saying they are not Fujianese and in fact support the protesters' demands.

Mix-ups and apologies

There also have been cases where places have become the target of activists' anger based on mistaken assumptions of China ties.

The Shanghai Commercial Bank is not mainland-owned but - despite its name - based in Hong Kong.

The Yifang bubble tea chain was also wrongly associated with the mainland when in fact it's from Taiwan.

In both those cases, the protesters wrongly targeted outlets only to later issue an apology and in some cases even help in the cleanup.

In order to avoid such mix-ups and to coordinate action, the activists have even come up with a colour-coding system.

The colours black, red and blue are used online to differentiate between thrashing a place, spay-painting it or simply boycotting it.

In the case of shops thought to support the protests, they're marked yellow with a call to actively support them.",HongKong,For those who are interested in why foreign brands like Starbucks were being attacked by protestors,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dgbfml/for_those_who_are_interested_in_why_foreign/,,

*but*

I propose that we take all this energy we're using to shame them and aim it towards **TikTok.**

And if you use it, uninstall it.

TikTok is owned by a massive Chinese conglomerate called ""ByteDance,"" and they censor content *not just in China,* but in the US and Europe as well, based on Chinese censorship guidelines:

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing

&gt;The documents, revealed by the Guardian for the first time, lay out how ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered technology company that owns TikTok, is advancing Chinese foreign policy aims abroad through the app.

And they are staunch supporters of the CCP (if not just directly run by the CCP):

&gt;CEO Zhang Yiming issued a letter in 2018 stating that his company would ""further deepen cooperation"" with Communist Party of China authorities to promote their policies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok#National_security_concerns_in_the_US

Reddit is here destroying US companies for making concessions to China, which is totally fair. But, at the same time, we're all posting TikToks all over reddit, and it's a top 5 app on both Google Play and the App Store.

I worry that we have forgotten who we're really trying to punish, here. Did Apple and Blizzard and the NBA fuck up? Yes. Do they deserve the heat? Yes. But damaging US companies to punish the CCP is a small hit. At worst, it actually *helps* the chinese economy if we boycott US companies.

Going after TikTok, who is deeply-entangled with the Chinese government (and lets be honest, probably just *is* the Chinese government) and is directly implementing China-style censorship around the globe is a much better move, IMO.

As some of you may know, [Blizzard recently banned a Hearthstone player from tournaments for a year and revoked his prize money because of his voicing support for the Hong Kong protests.](The Verge: Hearthstone player banned for supporting Hong Kong protesters during live stream.

The rather cowardly move to kowtow to the Chinese Communist Party simply to protect business interests, along with the cheapshot theft of the player's winnings, really leaves a foul taste. If you think that it isn't right for an American company to pander to a tyrannical regime and allow them to impose their authoritarian values onto our own culture, then I say that we counter whatever ""good grace"" Blizzard might've earned themselves with Beijing.



So let's give Mei a bit of a democratic streak. Use your creativity and show her standing in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong and don't allow Blizzard to bend over backward to please a criminal party that no upstanding company has any business interacting with!",Overwatch,Request: Could all of you Redditors with budding artistic talents please draw Mei stylised as a Hong Kong protestor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/df2sfx/request_could_all_of_you_redditors_with_budding/,,

SoI  sold my PC a year ago but I was hooked on Overwatch. I had spent over 1000 hours playing on PC and I was so happy and excited when I heard it was coming to switch. However, after what Blizzard has done to the [Hearthstone pro who expressed his support for Hong Kong protestors](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768245386/blizzard-entertainment-bans-esports-player-after-pro-hong-kong-comments), I just feel morally wrong if I were to purchase the game. I know others might not feel this way, and that's fine, but I was just curious what people's thoughts were from this sub?

It's an important subject that really needs as much attention as it gets.

The TL;DR of it is that Blizzard has sent a clear message that they support China and not Hong Kong.

Short summary: A high-profile player named Blitzchung won a Hearthstone tournament. In a post-tournament interview, the player spoke in support of Hong Kong. Blizzard invoked a clause of the tournament rules saying that this action ""damages their image"" and took Blitzchung's prize money away, banned him from tournaments for a year, and fired both interviewers. 

Here is the Reddit community's response:
